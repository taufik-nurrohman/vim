# NERDTree Unfocus

A shameless fork of [jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs](https://github.com/jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs) -- I just don't need all the feature this plugin provides. All I needed was a way to unfocus from the NERDTree buffer when switching tab, so that the tab will have a meaningful title.

## Installation

1. If you haven't already, install NERDTree (see https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)

2.  Install the plugin **through Pathogen**:

        cd ~/.vim/bundle
        git clone https://github.com/baopham/vim-nerdtree-unfocus.git

    Or **through Vundle**:

        Bundle 'baopham/vim-nerdtree-unfocus'

    Or **through Janus**:

        cd ~/.janus
        git clone https://github.com/baopham/vim-nerdtree-unfocus.git
