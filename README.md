My Minimalist Vim Setup
=======================

I started to think that I have to publish this repository. Someday I will probably move around that I have to use someone else&rsquo;s computer.

It will be convenient for me if I can just clone this repository to build a Vim editor with the same features and settings as my Vim editor in my home.

I am very open to all opinions and suggestions since I am a new Vim user here. However, I am currently don&rsquo;t accept pull requests on this repository, with the consideration that the contents of this repository are very personal. You can build your own Vim editor using this repository as a base to start with.
